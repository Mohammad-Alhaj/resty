- Properly `export` them as defaults
- Import them into the `App` Component using ES6 `import` statement
- Proper state management

### Lab Assistance Notes

- The first and most important part of the lab assignment is to draw a process diagram of the starter code and state as events happen. Once the students understand that, they can move on.
